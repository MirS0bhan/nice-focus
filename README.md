# Nice on Focus
!()[/assets/icon.png]
Nice on Focus is a small GNOME Shell extension that changes process niceness when window focus changes: it increases the priority (lowers the nice value) of the newly focused window's process tree and lowers the priority (raises the nice value) of the previously focused process so foreground apps stay responsive while background apps yield CPU. This project is licensed under the GPL.


NOTICE: This extension is not intended to have a noticeable impact on system performance.
